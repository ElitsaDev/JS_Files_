 ## Description
Welcome to my project! 
This very simple File Collecting App is made with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The user can click on the "Open Directory" button, which will open the Local File Explorer system (the name depends on your operating system). From there he can navigate to the desired directory on the local machine. In the input field, he can specify the name of the file and by clicking on the "Download" button he can download Txt file with all files in the selected directory. 
We hope you enjoy this app!
The app can be open in a browser by a Live Web server.
